# Keypirinha Plugin: EpicLauncher

This is EpicLauncher, a plugin for the
[Keypirinha](http://keypirinha.com) launcher.

The plugin enables searching and launching Epic Launcher games.

Due to limitations in the current state of the Epic Launcher, 
some informations may be wrong and all icons are defaulted to the Epic Launcher icon.

I'll update the plugin in the future.
